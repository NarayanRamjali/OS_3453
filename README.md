Program Discription:

This program is written in C language and it is my first program in C.
There are some requirements are still not complete. This progeam provides simple matrix multiplication using Pthred library. It writes the a.txt and b.txt files. 
I still have to figure out printing threads, and matrix multiplication from outer output (I mean using a.txt and b.txt). 
I spend alot time and I am working another program which is different form this program and that program included all the requirements but there is still some execution problem, so I submitted this executable code because it has atleast something to execute. I would like to request resubmit this lab one more time please.
Thank you.
